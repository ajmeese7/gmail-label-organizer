# gmail-label-organizer
Allows users to reorganize the Gmail system labels, i.e. to put the 'Important' label above 'Inbox'.

**NOTE:** This has only been tested in Firefox Developer Edition on Manjaro and Windows 10 so far.
Eventually, adding cross-browser compatibility, or developing different versions for different
browsers, is intended. I may add a list of platforms I've tested on soon as I continue testing 
and development.
